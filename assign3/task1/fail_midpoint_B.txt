Any input with negative numbers, or with a negative integer that is greater than its positive version will fail. The example that I used was -10 and 8. -10 is 0b 1111 0110, and 8 is 0b 0000 1000. The midpoint of -10 and 8 is -1.5, and -1 is the midpoint that should be printed out. Because midpoint B does not work with negative integers, 2147483647 is printed out instead. This number is 2^31 - 1, and is the maximum for a 32 bit system. Because B does not print out negative integers, it reverts to its maximum, which would be 2^31 - 1.
