I used 1 and 0 to fail midpoint_A test. It failed because 1 is 0b 0000 0001 and 0 is 0b 0000 0000. With integer division, the midpoint would be rounded down to its lowest whole number. The midpoint for 1 and 0 would be .5, so it rounds to 0. However, midpoint_A does not give out 0 and instead prints out 1, thus making it fail. This issue also applies with -1 and 0, which deals out the same issue when applied.
